1st Treehouse python challenge
I was unable to reproduce the error that you were getting.....
I am a little confused on why you receive the error and it runs like a top on my mac and windows pc....
any help is greatly appreciated

I was able to reporduce the errors by upgrading to python 3.6.4.  random.sample will not use a float as the second argument forcing this 
value to an int() resolved the errors
